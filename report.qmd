# Motivation

By exploring the current data and performing a detailed analysis,
researchers and enthusiasts can gain insights into the behavior,
distribution, and occurrence patterns of the Coastal Taipans in
Australia, which can be useful for a range of ecological, environmental,
and conservation studies.
:::

## Introduction {#sec-ref1}

The Taipan class of reptiles are indigenous to the land mass of
Australia as well as Papua New Guinea, and are considered to be one of
the deadliest snakes on the planet. The Taipan, scientifically known as
the Oxyuranus genus, comprises several species, with the Coastal Taipan
(Oxyuranus scutellatus) and the Inland Taipan (Oxyuranus microlepidotus)
being the most renowned. These reptiles are highly venomous and belong
to the elapid family, which includes other infamous snakes like the king
cobra and the black mamba. According to @markwell2016killer, what sets
the taipan apart, however, is its reputation as having the **most toxic
venom of any snake in the world!**

In our current analysis, we will be focusing on the occurrences of a
specific subspecies of the Coastal Taipan across the various states of
Australia. The subgroup of the Coastal Taipans which has been
scientifically named as Oxyuranus Scutellatus Scutellatus, is commonly
found in the northern regions of Australia and is renowned for its
agility and speed. It primarily feeds on small mammals, birds, and
occasionally reptiles, using its potent venom to immobilize its prey
swiftly.

![The coastal taipan (Oxyuranus scutellatus)](taipan.jpg){#fig-taipan}

Characterized by its slender body, shiny scales, and formidable fangs,
the Taipan is a formidable predator. Despite its fearsome reputation,
these snakes are generally reclusive and rarely encountered by humans.
They prefer to inhabit coastal regions, woodlands, and savannas,
blending seamlessly into their natural surroundings as can be observed
in @fig-taipan.

While the Coastal Taipans are not classified as endangered species,
however, with rapid human activities such as urbanisation and
encroachment of wildlife area for agricultural purposes, the habitat of
these reptiles have been increasingly affected as a result of which,
steps have been taken by wild life conservationists to preserve their
natural habitats to the best extent possible.

### Data source:

-   The data was sourced from the [Atlas of Living Australia
    (ALA)](https://www.ala.org.au/) using the `galah` R package.

-   The weather station data to study impact of weather conditions on
    sightings was sourced from [National Climatic Data Centre
    (NCDC)](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets) using `rnoaa`
    package in R.

# Key assumptions

Based on the literature surveys for the Coastal Taipan, here are our
assumptions while moving forward with our analysis:

1.  Based on the information from the [Australia
    Museum](https://australian.museum/learn/animals/reptiles/coastal-taipan/),
    the Coastal Taipans are **active throughout the year** but are
    observed to be most **commonly encountered during late winter to
    spring (August to December of a calendar year)**.
2.  As can be inferred from its colloquial name, the Coastal Taipans are
    often observed **in the coastal regions of Australia.**
3.  Based on a study by [Billabong
    Sanctuary](https://www.billabongsanctuary.com.au/coastal-taipan/#:~:text=Coastal%20taipans%20are%20common%20in,animals%20like%20rats%20and%20mice.),
    the Coastal Taipans are **not endangered and have probably increased
    in numbers** due to the growth in the number of rats (who are the
    primary prey) in areas close to the human settlements.
4.  Coastal Taipans depend primarily on their venom as their defensive
    mechanism and consider human interactions as an act of aggression.
    Consequently, the number of sightings across Australia can be
    **considered to be limited to certain regions and in small
    numbers**.
5.  The Coastal Taipans, like any other snakes are **territorial in
    nature and do not migrate from their region over the years**.
:::

Although we will attempt to accurately analyse the data by obtaining it
from reliable repositories, however, it is important to consider the
limitations of the dataset while making critical conclusions based on
the data in hand. Some of the limitations of the current dataset are
delineated as follows:

::: callout-warning
# Limitations of the data

1.  Since the data which has been obtained from the [Atlast of Living
    Australia](https://www.ala.org.au) falls under the category of
    **observational data**, there could be instances of missing values.
    These instances will need to be filtered out while analysing the
    data from the repository.

2.  Since the data is obtained from various sources, there could be
    inconsistencies in reporting the data.

3.  While the data collection was done in an extensive and granular
    manner, there could be a lack of precision of the observations made
    for the exact latitude and longitude.

4.  The dataset obtained from the Atlas of Living Australia **only
    reports for all the Coastal Taipans that have been sighted and
    recorded**. Hence, it does not report the entire population of these
    reptiles across the various regions of Australia. This may lead to
    inaccurate conclusions post analysis of the limited data in hand.

5.  The dataset here consist of **observational data** and in
    particular, occurrences data. Some of the limitations that are
    prevalent in such datasets are as follows :

    -   The data here is obtained from various sources. As a result,
        there may be **non-uniformity in the data provided**. Each
        reporting authority may have their own interpretations of the
        data they may have provided.
    -   The current dataset obtained is a subset of an observational
        data. These types of data are often plagued with lack of
        randomisation during the selection of data. This may lead to
        biases in the dataset such as selection and systematic bias.
    -   The data maybe misclassified or filled in non-uniform units by
        the various sources, leading to lack of accuracy of the overall
        dataset.

## Initial data analysis

### Data Source

**Data Source:** The data was sourced from the [Atlas of Living
Australia (ALA)](https://www.ala.org.au/) using the `galah` R package.

The weather station data to study impact of weather conditions on
sightings was sourced from [National Climatic Data Centre
(NCDC)](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets) using `rnoaa`
package in R.

### Data Cleaning

**Data Cleaning Steps:**

1.  The datatype for `eventDate` has been changed to datetime for
    accurate temporal analysis.\
2.  Observations with missing event dates, longitude, or latitude were
    filtered out.
3.  Redundant variables were dropped from the dataset to keep only the
    salient variables important for the current analysis.

**Methods to Check and Clean Data:**

-   **Validity Checks and outlier analysis:** Ensure that the latitude
    and longitude values are within valid ranges. For latitude (-90
    to 90) and for longitude (-180 to 180). This would help detect any
    unusual or erroneous data points.
-   **Consistency Checks:** Make sure there aren't any discrepancies in
    the way data is represented across rows.
-   **Missing Value Analysis:** Any missing values should be analyzed to
    understand the reason behind them.
-   **Date Consistency:** Ensure that the event dates fall within
    expected ranges and are formatted correctly.

### Data Quality Check

```{r}
#| label: fig-vismiss
#| fig-cap: "Representation of missing values in the dataset"
vis_miss(taipan)
```

The `vis_miss()` function from the "visdat" package provides a visual
representation of missing data in the dataset.

The plot illustrated in @fig-vismiss indicates **that about half of the
total dataset has missing values**. These missing values can be observed
majorly in the variables of eventRemarks,eventTime and eventID. In order
to improve the quality of the overall data, we will consider either
transforming these variables or removing them as a part of feature
selection in the following sections.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-fivenum
#| tbl-cap: "Representation of five number summary of values in the dataset"
lat_summary <- taipan$decimalLatitude %>% fivenum()
long_summary <- taipan$decimalLongitude %>% fivenum()

summary_table <- tibble(
  Statistic = c("Minimum", "1st Quartile", "Median", "3rd Quartile", "Maximum"),
  Latitude = lat_summary,
  Longitude = long_summary
) 

kable(summary_table, format = "html", table.attr = "class='table'") %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), position = "center") %>%
  column_spec(1, border_right = TRUE) %>%  # Add a line between columns
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "lightblue")

```

The `fivenum()` function in R provides a summary of five-number
statistics: the minimum, lower-hinge (25th percentile or first
quartile), median (50th percentile), upper-hinge (75th percentile or
third quartile), and the maximum.

By analyzing these statistics in @tbl-fivenum, we can get an overview of
the distribution of latitudes and longitudes in the dataset. **The five
number summary of the latitude and longitude values further allows us to
validate the values with each latitude and longitude observation being
within the maximum and minimum possible limits.**

### Data transformation and feature selection

As we are primarily interested in analysing the wild sightings of the
Coastal Taipans across Australia, hence, we will filter out the data
obtained from museums and animal sanctuaries. This information has been
provided in the `event ID` column which will be used to filter the
required data as shown in the code chunk below. It has been additionally
assumed that the occurrences with no mention of the term "museum" have
been considered as wild sightings in the context of the current study.

```{r}
#| label: fig-dist
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of Coastal Taipan sightings in Australia"
taipan <- taipan %>% mutate(occurrence = if_else(str_detect(taipan$eventID,"museum"),"Museum","Wild"))
taipan$occurrence <- replace_na(taipan$occurrence,"Wild")

taipan_occurrs <- taipan %>% group_by(occurrence) %>% summarise(Count =  n())  

ggplot(taipan_occurrs, aes(x = occurrence,y = Count)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = occurrence)) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Coastal Taipan sightings",
       x = "Occurrence Type",
       y = "Number of sightings") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") + geom_label(aes(label =Count))

```

Figure @fig-dist displays the distribution of Taipan sightings
categorized into two types: Museum and Wild. It's evident from the
figure that a portion of the data is sourced from museums, which means
these observations don't represent the natural behavior or occurrence of
Taipans in their wild habitats.

For a comprehensive study of the natural behavior or occurrence patterns
of Taipans, it's pertinent to focus solely on the "Wild" type data.

```{r}
 # Selecting only wild occurrences of Coastal Taipans
taipan_wild <- taipan %>% filter(occurrence =="Wild")
```

We have observed a total of **`r taipan %>% nrow()` occurrences across
Australia**. However, this number has been obtained from the raw data
which **will need to be cleaned further**.

::: {.alert .alert-block .alert-warning}
Based on the initial data analysis, we will need to perform the
following data cleaning operations:

1.  Filter the data with valid sighting date for detailed temporal
    analysis.
2.  Filter the data with valid values of longitude and latitude for
    detailed spatial analysis.
:::

```{r}
taipan_wild <- taipan_wild %>% 
  rename(Longitude = decimalLongitude,
         Latitude = decimalLatitude) %>%
  mutate(eventDate = as.Date(eventDate)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(eventDate)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(Longitude)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(Latitude)) %>% select(-c("samplingEffort","samplingProtocol","taxonConceptID","recordID","dataResourceName"))
save(taipan_wild, file=here::here("data/taipan.rda"))

```

::: {.alert .alert-block .alert-success}
‚ÄºÔ∏èüí° Upon performing the required data cleaning operation, we have a
total of **`r taipan_wild %>% nrow()` wild sightings of Coastal Taipans
across Australia**. üí°‚ÄºÔ∏è
:::

#### Combining data of sightings with weather data ‚õàÔ∏è

In order to explore the prevailing weather conditions during the
sighting, we will need to merge the datasets from two different sources.
Here, we will utilise the weather data reported from the various weather
stations in Australia by utilising the RNOAA package which is maintained
by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The
following code chunk allows us to obtain the weather conditions, namely
precipitation (PRCP), maximum temperature (TMAX) and minimum temperature
(TMIN). In order to utilise data from active weather stations, we have
filtered those data whose last reported conditions were relayed after
the year of 2020.

```{r}

aus_stations <- ghcnd_stations() |>
  filter(str_starts(id, "ASN")) |>
  filter(last_year >= 2020) |>
  mutate(wmo_id = as.numeric(wmo_id),
         name = str_to_lower(name)) |>
  select(-state, -gsn_flag) |>
  filter(element %in% c("PRCP", "TMAX", "TMIN")) |>
  nest(element: last_year) |>
  rowwise() |>
  filter(nrow(data) == 3) |>
  select(-data) 
```

Once we have obtained the weather data, we need to merge the sighting
data with the weather conditions. For this purpose, we can utilise the
geographical data (latitude and longitude) to merge the closest weather
station data with the location of the Coastal Taipan sighting.

::: {.alert .alert-block .alert-warning}
‚ÄºÔ∏è Since it is difficult to exactly match the latitude and longitude of
the sighting to the weather station, hence, we will convert the
geographical data into spatial objects and then utilise the nearest
feature function to merge the weather conditions of the location of the
sighting to the closest weather reporting station. This has been done in
the following code chunk. ‚ÄºÔ∏è
:::

```{r}


# Convert the datasets into spatial objects
taipan_sf <- st_as_sf(taipan_wild, coords = c("Longitude", "Latitude"), crs = 4326)
aus_stations_sf <- st_as_sf(aus_stations, coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), crs = 4326)

# Perform the nearest neighbor join
nearest_stations <- st_nearest_feature(taipan_sf, aus_stations_sf)

# Combine the datasets
combined_data <- cbind(taipan_wild, aus_stations[nearest_stations, ])

combined_data <- as.data.frame(combined_data)
unique_id <- unique(combined_data$id)
```

Once we have successfully mapped the sighting data with each of the
weather stations, let us try to observe the most frequent sightings with
respect to its closest weather station.

```{r}
#| label: fig-wstation
#| fig-cap: "Number of sightings for each weather station"
combined_count <- combined_data %>% group_by(name) %>% summarise(Count = n())
top_2 <- c("cooktown airport","townsville aero")

ggplot(combined_count,aes(x = reorder(name,Count),y = Count)) + geom_col() + coord_flip() + theme_classic() + ggtitle("Number of Coastal Taipan sightings \n for each weather station")  + geom_col(data = ~filter(.x, name %in% top_2),fill = "darkred") + geom_label(data = ~filter(.x, name %in% top_2),aes(label = Count),vjust=0.8) +  labs(x = "Weather station name",y = "Number of Coastal Taipan sightings",caption = "Source: National Climatic Data Center and Atlas of Living Australia")
```

@fig-wstation illustrates the number of Coastal Taipan sightings for
each of the weather stations in Australia. Based on the illustration, we
will be able to narrow down our search for the location with frequent
sightings of the reptile and can drill down our analysis to obtain
weather information.

Here, we observe that the weather stations Cooktown Airport and
Townsville Aero have significantly higher number of sightings when
compared to the rest of the data. Let us pull the weather information
for these weather stations through the below code chunk.

```{r}
narrogin <- aus_stations |>
  filter(name %in% top_2) |>
  rowwise() |>
  mutate(ts = list(meteo_pull_monitors(
    monitors = id, var = c("PRCP", "TMAX", "TMIN"),
    date_min = "1950-01-01",
    date_max = "2023-09-13") |>
      select(-id))) |>
  rename(Latitude = latitude, Longitude = longitude, elev = elevation) |> select(id, Longitude, Latitude, elev, name, wmo_id, ts) %>%
  unnest(ts) |>
  mutate(tmax = tmax/10, tmin = tmin/ 10)

```

In the next part, we will create a new variable called `sighting` with
values of either 0 or 1 to mark the sighting of the Coastal Taipan. This
variable is important because,

::: {.alert .alert-block .alert-warning}
the weather data obtained is for all the possible dates which match our
time period filter. **This does not necessarily mean that a Coastal
Taipan was observed on that particular day**. Hence, upon merging the
weather and the sighting dataset, it is **important to distinguish the
days (obtained by `eventDate`) which mark the sighting of a Coastal
Taipan**. We will be primarily interested to analyse the prevailing
weather conditions on these particular days for the choice of our
weather stations.
:::

```{r}
subset_combined_data <- combined_data %>% filter(name %in% top_2)
taipan_weather <- right_join(subset_combined_data,narrogin,by = c("id","eventDate"="date"))
taipan_weather <- taipan_weather %>% mutate(sighting = if_else(!is.na(occurrenceStatus) ,1,0))
save(taipan_weather, file=here::here("data/taipan_weather_sighting.rda"))
```

## Exploratory data analysis

```
### When are the Coastal Taipans most likely to be observed ?

```{r}
#| label: fig-sightnum
#| fig-cap: "Monthly number of Coastal Taipan sightings in Australia"
taipan_grouped <- taipan_wild %>% group_by(month(eventDate,label=TRUE)) %>% summarise(sightings = n())

taipan_grouped <- taipan_grouped %>% rename("month" = `month(eventDate, label = TRUE)`)



ggdotchart(taipan_grouped, y = "sightings", 
           x = "month",

                                                                       caption = "Source: Atlas of Linving Australia (ALA)",subtitle = "Time period: 1915-2020") + ggtitle("Total number of \n Coastal Taipan sightings in Australia")  

```

::: {.alert .alert-block .alert-warning}
üí° @fig-sightnum illustrates the number of Coastal Taipans reported till
date for each month. We can observe that the sightings are **higher
between the months of July to December** when compared to the rest of
the year. This can be a result of the prevailing monsoon conditions in
Australia which closely corroborates with our assumption stated in
@sec-ref1.

Some of the reasons why the Coastal Taipans are observed to be more
active are as follows:

1.  **Breeding season**: The Coastal Taipans are highly active during
    the breeding season which closely conincides with the monsoon season
    in Australia.
2.  **Increased prey availability**: The monsoon season in northern
    Australia typically brings heavy rainfall, which can lead to
    flooding in some areas. This flooding forces small mammals,
    reptiles, and other prey animals out of their burrows and hiding
    places, making them more accessible to Coastal Taipans. The
    increased prey availability during the monsoon can lead to an uptick
    in snake activity as they take advantage of the abundance of food.
3.  **Temperature and humidity**: Reptiles are ectothermic in nature,
    meaning their body temperature is highly influenced by the
    environmental temperature. Monsoon season generally brings about
    warm and humid conditions. These conditions additionally improve the
    metabolism and mobility in reptiles which allows for higher activity
    and increased number of Coastal Taipan sightings.
4.  **Migratory behaviour**: Due to increased mobility in the reptiles
    during the monsoon season, some Coastal Taipans exhibit migrate
    behaviour for better conditions and availability of prey. Migrations
    can often lead to human interactions and hence, their consequent
    sightings.

### Where are the Coastal Taipans most commonly observed in Australia? {#sec-ref2}

```{r}
#| label: fig-sightloc
#| fig-cap: "Regions of Coastal Taipan sightings in Australia"
# Assuming your dataset is named `sightings` and has columns `latitude` and `longitude`
leaflet(data = taipan) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircles(lng = ~decimalLongitude, lat = ~decimalLatitude, popup = paste("Scientific name:",taipan$scientificName, "<br>",
                                                              "Latitude:",taipan$decimalLatitude,"<br>",
                                                              "Longitude:",taipan$decimalLongitude,"<br>"), radius = 50, color = "red")

```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-source
#| tbl-cap: "Number of sightings reported by each data source"
sourceSightings <- taipan %>% 
                   group_by(dataResourceName) %>% 
                   summarise(count = n())
colnames(sourceSightings) <- c("Data Source", "Number of Sightings")

kable(sourceSightings, format = "html", table.attr = "class='table'") %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), position = "center") %>%
  column_spec(1, border_right = TRUE) %>%  # Add a line between columns
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "lightblue")
```

@fig-sightloc illustrates that, in alignment with its name, most Coastal
Taipan sightings occur in coastal regions. Additionally, considering
that a significant portion of the data comes from the "Queensland Museum
provider for OZCAM" as observed by @tbl-source, it can be determined
that a majority of these sightings are **concentrated in the coastal
areas of Queensland.** It is also particularly interesting to note that
**one sighting observed in the Northern Territory indicating a
possibility of migration and future possibilities of higher sightings in
this region.**

::: {.alert .alert-block .alert-warning}
üí°üí° The Coastal Taipan's preference for coastal regions in Australia
can be attributed to the habitat, climate, and prey availability in
these areas. Coastal regions provide a favorable environment with
adequate warmth, humidity, and shelter. These conditions are conducive
for the Taipan's survival and reproduction. Additionally, coastal areas
offer a rich biodiversity, ensuring ample prey for the snake. **The
vegetation in these regions, like grasslands and woodlands, offers
suitable hiding spots for the snake and its prey, leading to a higher
likelihood of the Taipan being found in these areas.**
:::

### Has there been a rise in the number of Coastal Taipans in Australia over the years?

```{r}
#| label: fig-trend
#| fig-cap: "Trend of Coastal Taipan Sightings Over the years of 1915-2020"
population_count <- taipan_wild %>% 
  mutate(year = year(eventDate)) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  filter(year != "1915") %>%
  summarise(count = n())

trend <- ggplot(population_count, aes(x = year, y = count)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = "Yearly Count"), linewidth = 1) +
  geom_smooth(aes(color = "Trend Line"), method = "loess", se = FALSE, size = 1.5,linetype = 'dashed') +
  labs(title = "Trend of Coastal Taipan Sightings Over the Years",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Number of Sightings",
       color = "Legend") +
  theme_classic()
ggplotly(trend)

```

@fig-trend demonstrates a noticeable increase in sightings over the
years, potentially suggesting a growth in the Coastal Taipan population,
indicating they **might not be "endangered".** However, there are
caveats to consider.

::: callout-warning
# Caveats

**Sightings vs. Population**: The number of sightings does not
necessarily equate to the actual population. An increase in sightings
could be due to increased human activity in the taipan's habitat or
better reporting mechanisms.

**Incomplete Data**: The dataset might not cover all sightings,
especially as it has limited data sources or regions.

**External Factors**: Factors like urban development, habitat
destruction, or climate change can influence the habitats and
distribution of species, which can subsequently influence sighting
reports.

### Are the Coastal Taipans limited to certain regions of Australia ?

In @sec-ref2, we were able to observe that the Coastal Taipans are
observed to be sighted close to the coasts. In this section, we will be
focused on assessing whether the sighting locations of the Coastal
Taipans suggest that these reptiles are limited to certain regions of
Australia only. The same will be assessed through the generation of a
null plot and testing a hypothesis. The hypothesis and the null
generating mechanism are as follows:

::: {.alert .alert-block .alert-warning}
$H_o$ : Coastal Taipans are not limited to a single region and can be
sighted all over Australia.\
$H_1$ : Coastal Taipans are limited to certain regions of Australia,
particularly in humid and warm conditions.

Null generating mechanism: Usage of the "null_permute" function to
permute the `latitude` values of the Coastal Taipan sightings.
:::

```{r}
#| label: fig-nullplot
#| fig-cap: "Null lineup plot for occurrences of Coastal Taipan sightings"
set.seed(1232536)
australia_map <- map_data("world", region = "Australia")


# Overlay the soccer pitch as a custom annotation on the scatter plot
map_null_plot <- ggplot() + geom_polygon(data = australia_map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), fill = "white", color = "black") +
   geom_point(data = lineup(null_permute("Latitude"),taipan_wild, n = 20),
                      aes(x = Longitude,y = Latitude),color = "red",alpha = 0.4) + facet_wrap(~.sample) + theme_classic() + theme(
    legend.position = "none",
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    axis.text = element_blank())
map_null_plot
```

::: callout-note
# Key takeaway

Upon analysing the plot null lineup plots in @fig-nullplot, we observed
that of the 8 test cases, **7 people were able to recognise the plot 4
as the most unique plot** due to the scatter points (sighting locations)
being limited to only the coastal regions of Australia. The P-value for
the following result is **`r pvisual(7,8,20)[3]`** which **suggests that
the null hypothesis can be rejected** and we can conclude that there is
significant evidence in the data to suggest that Coastal Taipans are
**majorly limited to the North-Eastern coast of Australia.**
:::

### Has the geographical distribution of Coastal Taipans remained consistent over the years?

Snakes are typically reclusive and territorial. Given this
characteristic, it's intriguing to consider whether coastal taipans
exhibit similar behavior. Specifically, it's of interest to determine if
coastal taipans remain in their established habitats due to their
inherent nature or external factors or if there are distinct regions
they consistently inhabit. This investigation will be facilitated by
generating a null plot and conducting hypothesis testing. The pertinent
hypotheses and the mechanism for generating the null distribution are
outlined as follows:

::: {.alert .alert-block .alert-warning}
$H_o$: The geographical distribution of Coastal Taipan sightings has
remained consistent over the years, with no significant difference in
distribution between the periods pre-2000s and post-2000s.\
$H_1$: The geographical distribution of Coastal Taipan sightings has
changed between the periods pre-2000s and post-2000s.

Null generating mechanism: Usage of the "null_permute" function to
permute the `eventCategory` (Pre or Post 2000s categorisation) values of
the Coastal Taipan sightings.
:::

```{r}
#| label: fig-lineup
#| fig-cap: "Null Distribution of Taipan Sightings by Location"
taipan_wild <- taipan_wild %>%
  mutate(eventCategory = ifelse(year(eventDate) < 2000, "pre-2000s", "post-2000s"))

set.seed(201349)

ggplot(lineup(null_permute('eventCategory'), taipan_wild), aes(x = Longitude, y= Latitude, color = eventCategory), n=20) +
  borders("world", regions = "Australia", fill = "white", colour = "black") +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~ .sample, nrow = 2) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_blank())


```

::: callout-note
# Key takeaway

Upon analysing the plot null lineup plots in @fig-lineup, we observed
that of the 8 test cases, **only 2 people were able to recognise the
plot 19 as the most unique plot due to the scatter points being limited
to only the coastal regions of Australia.** The P-value for the
following result is **`r pvisual(2,8,20)[3]`** which **suggests that the
null hypothesis cannot be rejected based on 95% confidence** and we can
conclude that there is significant evidence in the data to suggest that
Coastal Taipans are **consistently sighted in the same regions in
Australia over the years.**
:::

### How are the weather conditions like in the areas with Coastal Taipan sightings ?

In this section, we will be interested to find any insights with respect
to the weather in the locations with high Coastal Taipan sightings.

#### Does rain play a role in the sightings of the Coastal Taipans ? ‚õàÔ∏è

```{r}
#| label: fig-rain
#| fig-cap: "Number of Coastal Taipan sightings on days of observed precipitation"
taipan_rain <- taipan_weather %>% filter(sighting == 1) %>% mutate(rain = if_else(!is.na(prcp) & prcp> 0,"Rain recorded","No rain recorded"))

taipan_rain_group <-
  taipan_rain %>% group_by(rain) %>% summarise(Total = n())
rain_plot <-
  ggplot(data = taipan_rain_group, aes(
    x = as.factor(rain),
    y = Total,
    fill = factor(rain)
  )) + geom_col(color='black') + geom_label(aes(label = Total)) + theme_classic() + theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(x = "Rain indication for the day of sighting",y = "Total number of sightings")
rain_plot + scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3")
```

::: callout-note
# Key takeaway

Based on our analysis of @fig-rain, we can observe that of the 27
observations, **23 of the sightings took place on days with no recorded
precipitation** while **only 4 sightings took place on days with
recorded precipitation**. This suggests that the **precipitation may not
have a strong association with the Coastal Taipan sightings**. However,
it must also be kept in mind that the current sample of the dataset is
too small to generate any strong conclusions from the data and we may
require further data to support our analysis.
:::

#### How are the temperatures during the days of sightings ? ‚òÄÔ∏è

Let us now explore the minimum and maximum temperatures on the given day
of Coastal Taipan sightings and analyse any further insights.

```{r warning=FALSE}
#| label: fig-temp
#| fig-cap: "Temperature range on the days of Coastal Taipan sightings"
taipan_weather1 <- taipan_weather %>% filter(sighting == 1) 
taipan_weather1 <- taipan_weather1 %>% mutate(observation = 1:nrow(taipan_weather1))
taipan_weather1$observation <- factor(taipan_weather1$observation)
pl_temp <- ggplot(taipan_weather1, aes(y = observation)) +
  geom_dumbbell(aes(x = tmin, xend = tmax),
                color = "darkgray",
                size = 1, dot_guide = FALSE, 
                size_x = 3,  size_xend = 3,
                colour_xend = "#F69541", colour_x = "#699DC6") +
    geom_text(aes(x = tmin, label = tmin), hjust = 1.5) +
  geom_text(aes(x = tmax, label = tmax), hjust = -0.2) +
  xlim(0,40) + labs(x = "Minimum and maximum temperatures observed (degree Celsius)",
                                      y = "Coastal Taipan sighting unique observation")  + theme_classic()
   
pl_temp + geom_vline(xintercept = mean(taipan_weather1$tmax,na.rm = TRUE),alpha = 0.5,linetype =2,color = 'red') +  
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(taipan_weather1$tmin,na.rm = TRUE),alpha = 0.5,linetype =2,color = 'blue') +
    scale_linetype_manual(values = "Mean Temperature", name = "Line Type") +
    annotate(
    "text",
    x = 35,
    y = 8,
    colour = "red",
    label = paste0("Average maximum temperature:",round(mean(taipan_weather1$tmax,na.rm = TRUE),1)),
    size = unit(3, "pt") 
  ) +
      annotate(
    "text",
    x = 5,
    y = 14,
    colour = "blue",
    label = paste0("Average minimum temperature:",round(mean(taipan_weather1$tmin,na.rm = TRUE),1)),
    size = unit(3, "pt")
      )
  

```

::: callout-note
# Key takeaway

Upon analysing the maximum and minimum temperatures on the days of
Coastal Taipan sightings as illustrated by @fig-temp, we can observe
that the majority of the sightings were recorded on days with relatively
higher maximum and minimum temperatures. This suggests that the
**mobility of the reptiles are higher during warmer conditions** leading
to higher probability of their sightings. **Higher temperatures also
induce lower mobility among the prey of the Taipans to protect
themselves from the heat, as a result of which, the reptiles are also on
the move to hunt**.

The average maximum and minimum temperatures visualised by the two
vertical lines in the plot are 28.1 and 19 degree celsius respectively,
suggesting warm conditions.
:::

## Summary

Based on our detailed analysis of the Coastal Taipan sightings,
following are our key takeaways:

::: {.alert .alert-block .alert-warning}
üí°üí°\
1. The spatial analysis suggests that the Coastal Taipans are
territorial in nature, thereby inhabiting the coastal regions of
Queensland with possibility of migration towards Northern Territory in
the future.

2.  Based on the frequency of sightings, the Coastal Taipans are not
    endagered. However, they are extremely reclusive and avoid human
    contact. Hence, their occurrences and sightings are rare as they are
    mostly confined to their habitats.

3.  While migration of the Coastal Taipans maybe a possibility in the
    future, based on the data, there is not enough strong evidence to
    suggest that there has been a significant change in the Coastal
    Taipan's habitat.

4.  Contrary to popular belief, the data does not exhibit a strong
    evidence to suggest that the sightings of Coastal Taipans are higher
    on days of recorded precipitation. However, the Coastal Taipans do
    exhibit higher mobility during the monsoon period resulting in
    higher sightings.

5.  Coastal Taipans appear to be especially active on warm days,
    possibly due to their increased mobility and metabolism,
    consequently resulting in higher sightings on these days.

In the first part of this exploration, we were able to find that the
largest number of Coastal Taipan sightings occurred in two weather
stations - Cooktown airport and Townsville aero.

To understand whether seasonal patterns or decreasing or increasing
trends exist - we will subset our tourism data to areas with the most
sightings (as aforementioned).

```{r}
tourism_subset <- tourism[tourism$Region %in% c("Ingham", "Townsville City - North Ward", "Mackay", "Tewantin","Rockhampton City", "Gladstone", "Redcliffe", "Cairns City", "Daintree"),]

## What is Ecotourism?

Ecotourism encompasses nature-based activities and responsible travel
that conserves the environment and increases visitor appreciation and
understanding of natural and cultural values.
:::

***Why is Ecotourism important for the coastal Taipan?*** üêç

For Queensland, where our regions are for which we subset our data -
Tourism is a [\$23 billion
industry](https://parks.des.qld.gov.au/management/ecotourism/about%5D).
For the Coastal Taipan, the ecotourism industry allows visitors the
chance to observe and appreciate this species in its natural habitat -
without causing harm. Exploring and understanding sustainable ecotourism
can be significant in ensuring its survival and protection for future
generations.

## Does the Data Suggest Ecotourist Interest in the Coastal Taipan?

### Visual Inference of Ecotourism

As aforementioned, Queensland generates a lot of money from its tourism
industry. Given this, it would be interesting to investigate the
possibility of ecotourism centered around the coastal Taipan. To explore
this, a null plot will be generated to investigate the relationship
between tourist regions and coastal Taipan sightings.

::: {.alert .alert-block .alert-warning}
$H_o$ (null hypothesis): There is no association between tourist regions
and coastal Taipan sightings.

$H_1$ (alternative hypothesis): There is an association between tourist
regions and coastal Taipan sightings.

Null generating mechanism: usage of 'null_permute' function to permute
the "Avg_trips" (average trips computing for the subset regions) values,
breaking existing relationships between 'Sightings' of the Coastal
Taipan and 'Tourism Regions' with consideration to the average number of
trips to each tourist region.

# Key takeaway

When analysing the null plots in @fig-tourist-null, we were able to
deduce that 1 out of the 8 people asked were able to recognise **plot
20** as the most unique plot, and this was based purely on guessing
without a stated reason. The p-value for the following result is
**`r pvisual(1,8,20)[3]`**. With an significance level of 0.05 set, the
p-value derived suggests there is weak evidence against the null
hypothesis ($H_o$) that is that there is no association between Taipan
sightings and tourist regions.

Thus, with this p-value you would fail to reject the null hypothesis, as
the data suggests there is no strong evidence of an association between
the tourist regions and Taipan sightings.
:::

```{r}
library(nullabor)
pval <- pvisual(1,8,20)
pval
```

### Does the data support ecotourism for the coastal Taipan?

To explore whether ecotourist interest may potentially exist for the
Coastal Taipan, a map of Queensland was created using electoral division
data retrieved from the [Australian Electoral
Commission](https://www.aec.gov.au/Electorates/Redistributions/2017/qld/final-report/maps-data.htm).
Layered on top of this map, we placed points in pink of the sightings of
the Coastal Taipan. We also layered points which were major tourism
points that overlapped both in our sightings data and tourism data.
These points were collected using the `RJSONIO` library, which fetched
latitude and longitude details for each region in
`unique_regions_tourism` utilising the OpenStreetMap's Nominatim
service.

The generated plot in @fig-tourist-map showcases the regions in
Queensland with Coastal Taipan sightings in pink and tourism regions in
red. This plot therefore can assist in visualising the distribution of
these points and proximity of tourism regions to Taipain sighting to get
a better understanding in potential ecotourist interest in the Coastal
Taipan.

## Ecotourism and Taipan Sightings

Referring to @fig-tourist-map, we can draw a couple significant insights
in relation to Tourism Regions and Coastal Taipan sightings in
Queensland:

1.  Coastal Taipans, represented by the blue points can be seen
    predominantly along the eastern coast of Queesland, with some
    sightings further inland.
2.  There's overlap between Taipan sightings (blue points) and tourism
    regions (red points). This is evident towards the cost in southern
    and central parts of the state.
3.  There are sightings, particularly in the northern part of Queensland
    where multiple coastal Taipan sightings can be observed, without
    overlap in tourism regions.
:::

While there is some overlap in the coastal Taipan sightings and Tourist
regions, there are also some important things to consider:

-   The overlap between tourist regions and Taipan sightings does not
    necessarily indicate ecotourism centered around the Coastal Taipan.
    Queensland is known to be a popular tourist attraction, renowned for
    its diverse tourist attractions. For example, while Cairns city has
    overlap with Taipain sightings, its primarily known for its
    proximity to the Great Barrier Reef.

-   Our analysis was constrained by lack of available data. A lot of the
    regions for which coastal Taipan were sighted did not overlap in the
    available tourism data. This impedes a comprehensive understanding
    of potential ecotourism for the coastal Taipan.
