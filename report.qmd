# Motivation

By exploring the current data and performing a detailed analysis,
researchers and enthusiasts can gain insights into the behavior,
distribution, and occurrence patterns of the Coastal Taipans in
Australia, which can be useful for a range of ecological, environmental,
and conservation studies.
:::

## Introduction {#sec-ref1}

Australia, with its beautiful landscapes and unique wildlife, is a
popular destination for tourists from around the world. Among the
fascinating creatures found in this region, the Coastal Taipan
(Oxyuranus Scutellatus Scutellatus) takes the spotlight. These snakes
are native to both Australia and Papua New Guinea and are known for
their extremely venomous bites, making them some of the deadliest snakes
in the world. According to Markwell and Cushing (2016), what sets the
taipan apart, however, is its reputation as having the most toxic venom
of any snake in the world !

![The coastal taipan (Oxyuranus scutellatus)](taipan.jpg){#fig-taipan}

But there's more to these snakes than their dangerous reputation. The
Coastal Taipan and the Inland Taipan are the most well-known species in
their group, and they primarily inhabit the northern regions of
Australia, blending seamlessly into environments like coastal areas,
woodlands, and savannas as can be observed in Figure 1.

In this detailed analysis, we aim to explore the complex connection
between tourism in Australia and the encounters people have with the
Coastal Taipan. Our journey begins by carefully examining tourism data.
We'll look at trends such as the number of tourists, their reasons for
traveling, and their favorite destinations in different parts of
Australia. This initial step will help us understand when and where
tourists visit.

Moving from tourism to the study of nature, we will investigate data
related to sightings of Coastal Taipans. By combining this ecological
information with tourism trends, we hope to identify places where
tourism and these snakes' habitats overlap.

In the final part of our analysis, we will delve into the core question:
is there a significant link between the presence of these snakes and the
level of tourism in a particular area? Our goal is to decide whether
tourism has an impact on the sightings of these unique reptiles.

### Data source:

-   The data was sourced from the [Atlas of Living Australia
    (ALA)](https://www.ala.org.au/) using the `galah` R package.

-   The weather station data to study impact of weather conditions on
    sightings was sourced from [National Climatic Data Centre
    (NCDC)](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets) using `rnoaa`
    package in R.

# Key assumptions

Based on the literature surveys for the Coastal Taipan, here are our
assumptions while moving forward with our analysis:

1.  Based on the information from the [Australia
    Museum](https://australian.museum/learn/animals/reptiles/coastal-taipan/),
    the Coastal Taipans are **active throughout the year** but are
    observed to be most **commonly encountered during late winter to
    spring (August to December of a calendar year)**.
2.  As can be inferred from its colloquial name, the Coastal Taipans are
    often observed **in the coastal regions of Australia.**
3.  Based on a study by [Billabong
    Sanctuary](https://www.billabongsanctuary.com.au/coastal-taipan/#:~:text=Coastal%20taipans%20are%20common%20in,animals%20like%20rats%20and%20mice.),
    the Coastal Taipans are **not endangered and have probably increased
    in numbers** due to the growth in the number of rats (who are the
    primary prey) in areas close to the human settlements.
4.  Coastal Taipans depend primarily on their venom as their defensive
    mechanism and consider human interactions as an act of aggression.
    Consequently, the number of sightings across Australia can be
    **considered to be limited to certain regions and in small
    numbers**.
5.  The Coastal Taipans, like any other snakes are **territorial in
    nature and do not migrate from their region over the years**.
6.  We anticipate minimal convergence between snake sightings and
    tourist destinations, primarily due to the Taipan's reputation as
    the most venomous snake globally. It is unlikely that tourists would
    desire encountering them in their natural habitat; instead, they are
    more inclined to prefer observing these snakes in controlled
    environments such as sanctuaries or zoos.
7.  We would expect a consistent seasonality to be demonstrated for
    different visit reasons of the tourism in Queensland.
8.  We would expect that 'holiday' would be the main purpose of tourist
    travel to the selected regions in Queensland since it has a lot of
    tourist destination such as the [Great Barrier
    Reef](https://www.queensland.com/au/en/plan-your-holiday/news-and-articles/queensland-news/queensland-top-tourist-destination-in-the-world).
:::

Although we will attempt to accurately analyse the data by obtaining it
from reliable repositories, however, it is important to consider the
limitations of the dataset while making critical conclusions based on
the data in hand. Some of the limitations of the current dataset are
delineated as follows:

::: callout-warning
# Limitations of the data

1.  Since the data which has been obtained from the [Atlast of Living
    Australia](https://www.ala.org.au) falls under the category of
    **observational data**, there could be instances of missing values.
    These instances will need to be filtered out while analysing the
    data from the repository.

2.  Since the data is obtained from various sources, there could be
    inconsistencies in reporting the data.

3.  While the data collection was done in an extensive and granular
    manner, there could be a lack of precision of the observations made
    for the exact latitude and longitude.

4.  The dataset obtained from the Atlas of Living Australia **only
    reports for all the Coastal Taipans that have been sighted and
    recorded**. Hence, it does not report the entire population of these
    reptiles across the various regions of Australia. This may lead to
    inaccurate conclusions post analysis of the limited data in hand.

5.  The dataset here consist of **observational data** and in
    particular, occurrences data. Some of the limitations that are
    prevalent in such datasets are as follows :

    -   The data here is obtained from various sources. As a result,
        there may be **non-uniformity in the data provided**. Each
        reporting authority may have their own interpretations of the
        data they may have provided.
    -   The current dataset obtained is a subset of an observational
        data. These types of data are often plagued with lack of
        randomisation during the selection of data. This may lead to
        biases in the dataset such as selection and systematic bias.
    -   The data maybe misclassified or filled in non-uniform units by
        the various sources, leading to lack of accuracy of the overall
        dataset.

6.  The sample size of the wild sightings of Taipan might be too limited
    to draw any meaning conclusion.

7.  Lack of available data in the tourism data set. Some of the major
    regions with sightings could not be found in the tourism data set
    (e.g. Cooktown) leading to Daintree being used as a proxy.

8.  Assumption of NA's being treated as wild sightings under "eventID"
    column would lead to overestimation of wild sightings of Taipan as
    we cannot distinguish whether the NA's were due to missing
    information.

## Initial data analysis

### Data Source

**Data Source:** The data was sourced from the [Atlas of Living
Australia (ALA)](https://www.ala.org.au/) using the `galah` R package.

The weather station data to study impact of weather conditions on
sightings was sourced from [National Climatic Data Centre
(NCDC)](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets) using `rnoaa`
package in R.

Tourism data was downloaded from Monash A-Z Databases: ["Tourism
Research Australia online for students"](https://www.tra.gov.au/).

### Data Cleaning

**Data Cleaning Steps:**

[Sightings Data]{.underline}

1.  The datatype for `eventDate` has been changed to datetime for
    accurate temporal analysis.
2.  Observations with missing event dates, longitude, or latitude were
    filtered out.
3.  Redundant variables were dropped from the dataset to keep only the
    salient variables important for the current analysis.

[Tourism Data]{.underline}

1.  **Quarter -** Missing values are filled using `fill()` function. N/A
    values filled with the last observed non-N/A value. Rows with
    'Total' were filtered out.
2.  **Region -** Rows with 'Total' were filtered out, excluding summary
    data.
3.  **Purpose -** Created with `pivot_longer()`, where "Holiday" and
    "Total" were put into two new columns "Purpose" (reason for travel)
    and "Trips" (number of trips for that purpose).
4.  **Trips** **-** Contains the number of trips for each purpose. Data
    was sourced from "Total" column via `pivot_longer().`

### Data Quality Check

```{r}
#| label: fig-vismiss
#| fig-cap: "Representation of missing values in the dataset"
#| eval: false
vis_miss(taipan)
```

The result of the vis_miss() indicates **that about half of the total
dataset has missing values**. These missing values can be observed
majorly in the variables of eventRemarks, eventTime and eventID. In
order to improve the quality of the overall data, we will consider
either transforming these variables or removing them as a part of
feature selection in the following sections.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-fivenum
#| tbl-cap: "Representation of five number summary of values in the dataset"
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
lat_summary <- taipan$decimalLatitude %>% fivenum()
long_summary <- taipan$decimalLongitude %>% fivenum()

summary_table <- tibble(
  Statistic = c("Minimum", "1st Quartile", "Median", "3rd Quartile", "Maximum"),
  Latitude = lat_summary,
  Longitude = long_summary
) 

kable(summary_table, format = "html", table.attr = "class='table'") %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), position = "center") %>%
  column_spec(1, border_right = TRUE) %>%  # Add a line between columns
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "lightblue")

```

### Data transformation and feature selection

As we are primarily interested in analysing the wild sightings of the
Coastal Taipans across Australia, hence, we will filter out the data
obtained from museums and animal sanctuaries. This information has been
provided in the `event ID` column which will be used to filter the
required data as shown in the code chunk below. It has been additionally
assumed that the occurrences with no mention of the term "museum" have
been considered as wild sightings in the context of the current study.

```{r}
taipan <- taipan %>% mutate(occurrence = if_else(str_detect(taipan$eventID,"museum"),"Museum","Wild"))
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-dist
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of Coastal Taipan sightings in Australia"
#| echo: false
#| include: false
taipan$occurrence <- replace_na(taipan$occurrence,"Wild")

taipan_occurrs <- taipan %>% group_by(occurrence) %>% summarise(Count =  n())  

ggplot(taipan_occurrs, aes(x = occurrence,y = Count)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = occurrence)) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Coastal Taipan sightings",
       x = "Occurrence Type",
       y = "Number of sightings") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") + geom_label(aes(label =Count))

```

Figure @fig-dist displays the distribution of Taipan sightings
categorized into two types: Museum and Wild. It's evident from the
figure that a portion of the data is sourced from museums, which means
these observations don't represent the natural behavior or occurrence of
Taipans in their wild habitats.

For a comprehensive study of the natural behavior or occurrence patterns
of Taipans, it's pertinent to focus solely on the "Wild" type data.

```{r}
 # Selecting only wild occurrences of Coastal Taipans
taipan_wild <- taipan %>% filter(occurrence =="Wild")
```

We have observed a total of **`r taipan %>% nrow()` occurrences across
Australia**. However, this number has been obtained from the raw data
which **will need to be cleaned further**.

::: {.alert .alert-block .alert-warning}
Based on the initial data analysis, we will need to perform the
following data cleaning operations:

1.  Filter the data with valid sighting date for detailed temporal
    analysis.
2.  Filter the data with valid values of longitude and latitude for
    detailed spatial analysis.
:::

```{r}
taipan_wild <- taipan_wild %>% 
  rename(Longitude = decimalLongitude,

#### Combining data of sightings with weather data ‚õàÔ∏è

In order to explore the prevailing weather conditions during the
sighting, we will need to merge the datasets from two different sources.
Here, we will utilise the weather data reported from the various weather
stations in Australia by utilising the RNOAA package which is maintained
by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The
following code chunk allows us to obtain the weather conditions, namely
precipitation (PRCP), maximum temperature (TMAX) and minimum temperature
(TMIN). In order to utilise data from active weather stations, we have
filtered those data whose last reported conditions were relayed after
the year of 2020.

```{r}
#| echo: false
aus_stations <- ghcnd_stations() |>
  filter(str_starts(id, "ASN")) |>
  filter(last_year >= 2020) |>
  mutate(wmo_id = as.numeric(wmo_id),
         name = str_to_lower(name)) |>
  select(-state, -gsn_flag) |>
  filter(element %in% c("PRCP", "TMAX", "TMIN")) |>
  nest(element: last_year) |>
  rowwise() |>
  filter(nrow(data) == 3) |>
  select(-data) 
```

Once we have obtained the weather data, we need to merge the sighting
data with the weather conditions. For this purpose, we can utilise the
geographical data (latitude and longitude) to merge the closest weather
station data with the location of the Coastal Taipan sighting.

::: {.alert .alert-block .alert-warning}
‚ÄºÔ∏è Since it is difficult to exactly match the latitude and longitude of
the sighting to the weather station, hence, we will convert the
geographical data into spatial objects and then utilise the nearest
feature function to merge the weather conditions of the location of the
sighting to the closest weather reporting station. This has been done in
the following code chunk. ‚ÄºÔ∏è
:::

```{r}
# Convert the datasets into spatial objects
taipan_sf <- st_as_sf(taipan_wild, coords = c("Longitude", "Latitude"), crs = 4326)
aus_stations_sf <- st_as_sf(aus_stations, coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), crs = 4326)

# Perform the nearest neighbor join
nearest_stations <- st_nearest_feature(taipan_sf, aus_stations_sf)

# Combine the datasets
combined_data <- cbind(taipan_wild, aus_stations[nearest_stations, ])

combined_data <- as.data.frame(combined_data)
unique_id <- unique(combined_data$id)
```

Once we have successfully mapped the sighting data with each of the
weather stations, let us try to observe the most frequent sightings with
respect to its closest weather station.

```{r}
#| label: fig-wstation
#| fig-cap: "Number of sightings for each weather station"
#| echo: false
combined_count <- combined_data %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  summarise(Count = n())

top_2 <- c("cooktown airport","townsville aero")

ggplot(combined_count,aes(x = reorder(name,Count),y = Count)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  coord_flip() + 
  theme_classic() + 
  ggtitle("Number of Coastal Taipan sightings \n for each weather station")  + 
  geom_col(data = ~filter(.x, name %in% top_2),fill = "darkred") + 
  geom_label(data = ~filter(.x, name %in% top_2),aes(label = Count),vjust=0.8) +  
  labs(x = "Weather station name",
       y = "Number of Coastal Taipan sightings",
       caption = "Source: National Climatic Data Center and Atlas of Living Australia")
```

@fig-wstation illustrates the number of Coastal Taipan sightings for
each of the weather stations in Australia. Based on the illustration, we
will be able to narrow down our search for the location with frequent
sightings of the reptile and can drill down our analysis to obtain
weather information.

Here, we observe that the weather stations Cooktown Airport and
Townsville Aero have significantly higher number of sightings when
compared to the rest of the data.

```{r}
#| echo: false
narrogin <- aus_stations |>
  filter(name %in% top_2) |>
  rowwise() |>
  mutate(ts = list(meteo_pull_monitors(
    monitors = id, var = c("PRCP", "TMAX", "TMIN"),
    date_min = "1950-01-01",
    date_max = "2023-09-13") |>
      select(-id))) |>
  rename(Latitude = latitude, Longitude = longitude, elev = elevation) |> select(id, Longitude, Latitude, elev, name, wmo_id, ts) %>%
  unnest(ts) |>
  mutate(tmax = tmax/10, tmin = tmin/ 10)

```

::: {.alert .alert-block .alert-warning}
the weather data obtained is for all the possible dates which match our
time period filter. **This does not necessarily mean that a Coastal
Taipan was observed on that particular day**. Hence, upon merging the
weather and the sighting dataset, it is **important to distinguish the
days (obtained by `eventDate`) which mark the sighting of a Coastal
Taipan**. We will be primarily interested to analyse the prevailing
weather conditions on these particular days for the choice of our
weather stations.

```

::: {.alert .alert-block .alert-warning}
üí° @fig-sightnum illustrates the number of Coastal Taipans reported till
date for each month. We can observe that the sightings are **higher
between the months of July to December** when compared to the rest of
the year. This can be a result of the prevailing monsoon conditions in
Australia which closely corroborates with our assumption stated in
@sec-ref1.

Some of the reasons why the Coastal Taipans are observed to be more
active are as follows:

1.  **Breeding season**: The Coastal Taipans are highly active during
    the breeding season which closely conincides with the monsoon season
    in Australia.
2.  **Increased prey availability**: The monsoon season in northern
    Australia typically brings heavy rainfall, which can lead to
    flooding in some areas. This flooding forces small mammals,
    reptiles, and other prey animals out of their burrows and hiding
    places, making them more accessible to Coastal Taipans. The
    increased prey availability during the monsoon can lead to an uptick
    in snake activity as they take advantage of the abundance of food.
3.  **Temperature and humidity**: Reptiles are ectothermic in nature,
    meaning their body temperature is highly influenced by the
    environmental temperature. Monsoon season generally brings about
    warm and humid conditions. These conditions additionally improve the
    metabolism and mobility in reptiles which allows for higher activity
    and increased number of Coastal Taipan sightings.
4.  **Migratory behaviour**: Due to increased mobility in the reptiles
    during the monsoon season, some Coastal Taipans exhibit migrate
    behaviour for better conditions and availability of prey. Migrations
    can often lead to human interactions and hence, their consequent
    sightings.

  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "lightblue")
```

@fig-sightloc illustrates that, in alignment with its name, most Coastal
Taipan sightings occur in coastal regions.

::: {.alert .alert-block .alert-warning}
üí°üí° The Coastal Taipan's preference for coastal regions in Australia
can be attributed to the habitat, climate, and prey availability in
these areas. Coastal regions provide a favorable environment with
adequate warmth, humidity, and shelter. These conditions are conducive
for the Taipan's survival and reproduction. Additionally, coastal areas
offer a rich biodiversity, ensuring ample prey for the snake. **The
vegetation in these regions, like grasslands and woodlands, offers
suitable hiding spots for the snake and its prey, leading to a higher
likelihood of the Taipan being found in these areas.**
:::

### Has the geographical distribution of Coastal Taipans remained consistent over the years?

Snakes are typically reclusive and territorial. Given this
characteristic, it's intriguing to consider whether coastal taipans
exhibit similar behavior. Specifically, it's of interest to determine if
coastal taipans remain in their established habitats due to their
inherent nature or external factors or if there are distinct regions
they consistently inhabit. This investigation will be facilitated by
generating a null plot and conducting hypothesis testing. The pertinent
hypotheses and the mechanism for generating the null distribution are
outlined as follows:

::: {.alert .alert-block .alert-warning}
$H_o$: The geographical distribution of Coastal Taipan sightings has
remained consistent over the years, with no significant difference in
distribution between the periods pre-2000s and post-2000s.\
$H_1$: The geographical distribution of Coastal Taipan sightings has
changed between the periods pre-2000s and post-2000s.

Null generating mechanism: Usage of the "null_permute" function to
permute the `eventCategory` (Pre or Post 2000s categorisation) values of
the Coastal Taipan sightings.
:::

```{r}
#| label: fig-lineup
#| fig-cap: "Null Distribution of Taipan Sightings by Location"
#| echo: false
taipan_wild <- taipan_wild %>%
  mutate(eventCategory = ifelse(year(eventDate) < 2000, "pre-2000s", "post-2000s"))

set.seed(201349)

ggplot(lineup(null_permute('eventCategory'), taipan_wild), aes(x = Longitude, y= Latitude, color = eventCategory), n=20) +
  borders("world", regions = "Australia", fill = "white", colour = "black") +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~ .sample, ncol = 5) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_blank())


```

::: callout-note
# Key takeaway

Upon analysing the plot null lineup plots in @fig-lineup, we observed
that of the 8 test cases, **only 2 people were able to recognise the
plot 19 as the most unique plot due to the scatter points being limited
to only the coastal regions of Australia.** The P-value for the
following result is **`r pvisual(2,8,20)[3]`** which **suggests that the
null hypothesis cannot be rejected based on 95% confidence** and we can
conclude that there is significant evidence in the data to suggest that
Coastal Taipans are **consistently sighted in the same regions in
Australia over the years.**

### How are the weather conditions like in the areas with Coastal Taipan sightings ?

In this section, we will be interested to find any insights with respect
to the weather in the locations with high Coastal Taipan sightings.

#### Does rain play a role in the sightings of the Coastal Taipans ? ‚õàÔ∏è

```{r}
#| label: fig-rain
#| fig-cap: "Number of Coastal Taipan sightings on days of observed precipitation"
#| echo: false
taipan_rain <- taipan_weather %>% filter(sighting == 1) %>% mutate(rain = if_else(!is.na(prcp) & prcp> 0,"Rain recorded","No rain recorded"))

taipan_rain_group <-
  taipan_rain %>% group_by(rain) %>% summarise(Total = n())
rain_plot <-
  ggplot(data = taipan_rain_group, aes(
    x = as.factor(rain),
    y = Total,
    fill = factor(rain)
  )) + geom_col(color='black') + geom_label(aes(label = Total)) + theme_classic() + theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(x = "Rain indication for the day of sighting",y = "Total number of sightings")
rain_plot + scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3")
```

::: callout-note
# Key takeaway

Based on our analysis of @fig-rain, we can observe that of the 27
observations, **23 of the sightings took place on days with no recorded
precipitation** while **only 4 sightings took place on days with
recorded precipitation**. This suggests that the **precipitation may not
have a strong association with the Coastal Taipan sightings**. However,
it must also be kept in mind that the current sample of the dataset is
too small to generate any strong conclusions from the data and we may
require further data to support our analysis.
:::

#### How are the temperatures during the days of sightings ? ‚òÄÔ∏è

Let us now explore the minimum and maximum temperatures on the given day
of Coastal Taipan sightings and analyse any further insights.

    label = paste0("Average minimum temperature:",round(mean(taipan_weather1$tmin,na.rm = TRUE),1)),
    size = unit(3, "pt")
      )
  

```

::: callout-note
# Key takeaway

Upon analysing the maximum and minimum temperatures on the days of
Coastal Taipan sightings as illustrated by @fig-temp, we can observe
that the majority of the sightings were recorded on days with relatively
higher maximum and minimum temperatures. This suggests that the
**mobility of the reptiles are higher during warmer conditions** leading
to higher probability of their sightings. **Higher temperatures also
induce lower mobility among the prey of the Taipans to protect
themselves from the heat, as a result of which, the reptiles are also on
the move to hunt**.

The average maximum and minimum temperatures visualised by the two
vertical lines in the plot are 28.1 and 19 degree celsius respectively,
suggesting warm conditions.

## What is Ecotourism?

Ecotourism encompasses nature-based activities and responsible travel
that conserves the environment and increases visitor appreciation and
understanding of natural and cultural values.
:::

***Why is Ecotourism important for the coastal Taipan?*** üêç

For Queensland, where our regions are for which we subset our data -
Tourism is a [\$23 billion
industry](https://parks.des.qld.gov.au/management/ecotourism/about%5D).
For the Coastal Taipan, the ecotourism industry allows visitors the
chance to observe and appreciate this species in its natural habitat -
without causing harm. Exploring and understanding sustainable ecotourism
can be significant in ensuring its survival and protection for future
generations.

## Does the Data Suggest Ecotourist Interest in the Coastal Taipan?

### Visual Inference of Ecotourism

As aforementioned, Queensland generates a lot of money from its tourism
industry. Given this, it would be interesting to investigate the
possibility of ecotourism centered around the coastal Taipan. To explore
this, a null plot will be generated to investigate the relationship
between tourist regions and coastal Taipan sightings.

::: {.alert .alert-block .alert-warning}
$H_o$ (null hypothesis): There is no association between popularity of
the tourist regions and coastal Taipan sightings.

$H_1$ (alternative hypothesis): There is an association between popular
tourist regions and coastal Taipan sightings.

Null generating mechanism: usage of 'null_permute' function to permute
the "Avg_trips" (quarterly average trips computing for the subset
regions) values, breaking existing relationships between quarterly
average trips and popular tourism regions.

# Key takeaway

When analysing the null plots in @fig-tourist-null, we were able to
deduce that 0 out of the 8 people asked were able to recognise **plot
20** as the most unique plot, and this was based on not being able to
see a pattern which stood out differently to the other plots. The
p-value for the following result is **`r pvisual(0,8,20)[3]`**. With an
significance level of 0.05 set, the p-value derived suggests there is
weak evidence against the null hypothesis ($H_o$) that is that there is
no association between Taipan sightings and the popularity of tourist
regions. Furthermore, we run a correlation test and linear regression
model with wild sighting being the dependent variable and quarter
average trips being the independent variable. The correlation
(`r round(corr, 4)`) between the two variables is insignificant as well
as the R-square (`r round(r_squared[[1]], 4)`) of the linear regression
model is negligible.

Thus, with this p-value you would fail to reject the null hypothesis, as
the data suggests there is no strong evidence of an association between
the popular tourist regions and Taipan sightings.

### Does the data support ecotourism for the coastal Taipan?

To explore whether ecotourist interest may potentially exist for the
Coastal Taipan, a map of Queensland was created using electoral division
data retrieved from the [Australian Electoral
Commission](https://www.aec.gov.au/Electorates/Redistributions/2017/qld/final-report/maps-data.htm).
Layered on top of this map, we placed points representing the sightings
of the Coastal Taipan. We also layered points which were illustrated
major tourism regions, with size indicating popularity of that region.
These points were collected using the `RJSONIO` library, which fetched
latitude and longitude details for each selected tourist region in
`unique_regions_tourism` utilising the OpenStreetMap's Nominatim
service.

The generated plot in @fig-tourist-map showcases the regions in
Queensland with Coastal Taipan sightings in blue and tourism regions in
red. This plot therefore can assist in visualising the distribution of
these points and proximity of tourism regions to Taipain sighting to get
a better understanding in potential ecotourist interest in the Coastal
Taipan, as well as if popularity in tourism region contributes to higher
likelihood of sightings.

## Ecotourism and Taipan Sightings

Referring to @fig-tourist-map, we can draw some insights in relation to
Tourism Regions and Coastal Taipan sightings in Queensland:

1.  Coastal Taipans, represented by the blue points can be seen
    predominantly along the eastern coast of Queesland, with some
    sightings further inland.
2.  There's overlap between Taipan sightings (blue points) and tourism
    regions (red points). This is evident towards the cost in southern
    and central parts of the state.
3.  There are sightings, particularly in the northern part of Queensland
    where multiple coastal Taipan sightings can be observed, without
    overlap in tourism regions.
:::

While there is some overlap in the coastal Taipan sightings and Tourist
regions, there are also some important things to consider:

-   The overlap between tourist regions and Taipan sightings does not
    necessarily indicate ecotourism centered around the Coastal Taipan.
    Queensland is known to be a popular tourist attraction, renowned for
    its diverse tourist attractions. For example, while Cairns city has
    overlap with Taipain sightings, its primarily known for its
    proximity to the Great Barrier Reef.

-   Our analysis was constrained by lack of available data. A lot of the
    regions for which coastal Taipan were sighted did not overlap in the
    available tourism data. This impedes a comprehensive understanding
    of potential ecotourism for the coastal Taipan.

## Summary

Based on our detailed analysis of the Coastal Taipan sightings,
following are our key takeaways:

::: {.alert .alert-block .alert-warning}
üí°üí°\
The analysis focused on the behavior and distribution of Coastal Taipans
(Oxyuranus Scutellatus Scutellatus) in the coastal regions of
Queensland. The findings suggest that Coastal Taipans are territorial
creatures, primarily inhabiting Queensland's coastal areas, with
potential migration towards the Northern Territory in the future.

Despite being less frequent in sightings, Coastal Taipans are not
considered endangered. They are elusive and tend to avoid human contact,
making their sightings rare as they prefer to stay within their
habitats.

Contrary to popular belief, the data does not strongly support the idea
that Coastal Taipans are more commonly sighted on days with recorded
precipitation. However, they do exhibit higher mobility during the
monsoon period, leading to an increase in sightings.

The research with the tourism dataset, initially focusing on regions
near Townsville due to their connection to Coastal Taipan sightings. The
study then narrowed its focus to Townsville City - North Ward, which had
a significantly higher number of wild sightings compared to areas near
the Townsville airport. Subsequently, the analysis identified the top
nine regions with the highest number of wild sightings for temporal
analysis: Ingham, Townsville City - North Ward, Mackay, Tewantin,
Rockhampton City, Gladstone, Redcliffe, Cairns City, and Daintree.

The research merged the tourism dataset with the wild sighting data to
investigate the relationship between tourism activity and the
occurrences of Coastal Taipan sightings. The visualizations and more
precise analysis, including permutation tests, were carried out.
However, when eight individuals assessed these visuals, none of them
could identify distinctions among the representations, which seemed to
be due to chance rather than any valid reasons.

The hypothesis testing led to a p-value of 1, resulting in a failure to
reject the **null hypothesis (**$H_o$): There is no association between
the popularity of tourist regions and Coastal Taipan sightings.

In summary, the study reveals that Coastal Taipans are territorial and
not endangered, although they are reclusive and rarely seen due to their
preference for isolated habitats. The data does not strongly support the
idea that precipitation directly influences their sightings. and the
analysis of tourism data did not find a significant association between
tourist popularity and Coastal Taipan sightings, as indicated by the
p-value of 1.
