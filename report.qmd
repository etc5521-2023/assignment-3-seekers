## Introduction

The Taipan class of reptiles are indigenous to the land mass of Australia as well as Papua New Guinea, and are considered to be one of the deadliest snakes on the planet. The Taipan, scientifically known as the Oxyuranus genus, comprises several species, with the Coastal Taipan (Oxyuranus scutellatus) and the Inland Taipan (Oxyuranus microlepidotus) being the most renowned. These reptiles are highly venomous and belong to the elapid family, which includes other infamous snakes like the king cobra and the black mamba. According to @markwell2016killer, what sets the taipan apart, however, is its reputation as having the most toxic venom of any snake in the world !

In our current analysis, we will be focusing on the occurrences of Coastal Taipan across the various states of Australia. The coastal Taipan which has been scientifically named as Oxyuranus scutellatus, is commonly found in the northern regions of Australia and is renowned for its agility and speed. It primarily feeds on small mammals, birds, and occasionally reptiles, using its potent venom to immobilize its prey swiftly.

Characterized by its slender body, shiny scales, and formidable fangs, the Taipan is a formidable predator. Despite its fearsome reputation, these snakes are generally reclusive and rarely encountered by humans. They prefer to inhabit coastal regions, woodlands, and savannas, blending seamlessly into their natural surroundings as can be observed in @fig-taipan.

While the Coastal Taipans are not classified as endangered species, however, with rapid human activities such as urbanisation and encroachment of wildlife area for agricultural purposes, the habitat of these reptiles have been increasingly affected as a result of which, steps have been taken by wild life conservationists to preserve their natural habitats to the best extent possible.

# Key assumptions

Based on the literature surveys for the Costal Taipan, here are our assumptions while moving forward with our analysis:

1. Based on the information from the [Australia Museum](https://australian.museum/learn/animals/reptiles/coastal-taipan/), the Costal Taipans are __active throughout the year__ but are observed to be most __commonly encountered during late winter to spring (August to December of a calendar year)__.
2. As can be inferred from its colloquial name, the Coastal Taipans are often observed __in the coastal regions of Australia and thrive in the monsoon wetlands and savannas__.
3. Based on a study by [Billabong Sanctuary](https://www.billabongsanctuary.com.au/coastal-taipan/#:~:text=Coastal%20taipans%20are%20common%20in,animals%20like%20rats%20and%20mice.), the Coastal Taipans are __not endangered and have probably increased in numbers__ due to the growth in the number of rats (who are the primary prey) in areas close to the human settlements.

## Data description

<!--
2. Download all the occurrence records from the Atlas of Living Australia, ideally scripted using the `atlas_occurrences()` function from the `galah` package. Make sure you include date, time, collector identification details. Save this into a `data-raw` folder in your repo.
-->

## Initial data analysis

<!--
3. Perform a data quality check, and then go ahead and clean the data, saving only the wild sightings. Save the resulting data in a `data` folder as an `WILD_THING_COMMON_NAME.rda` file, so that any special variable types are clearly available. (Replace `WILD_THING_COMMON_NAME` with lower case common name of your assigned wild thing.) *Note:* Some are museum or historical records or live in an animal sanctuary or zoo, which do not truly capture their wild behaviour. Downloading the event information (`galah_select(group = "event")`) can help identify wild sightings.

Weather data pre-processing here too.
-->

## Exploratory data analysis

<!--
4. Make plots of the data to check each of your expectations, and report what you learn. *Note:* This might also be a place where visual inference methods *may* be useful to determine if what is seen agrees or disputes what you expected. 

Weather data exploration here too.
