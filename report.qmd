# Motivation
By exploring the current data and performing a detailed analysis, researchers and enthusiasts can gain insights into the behavior, distribution, and occurrence patterns of the Coastal Taipans in Australia, which can be useful for a range of ecological, environmental, and conservation studies.
:::
## Introduction {#sec-ref1}

The Taipan class of reptiles are indigenous to the land mass of Australia as well as Papua New Guinea, and are considered to be one of the deadliest snakes on the planet. The Taipan, scientifically known as the Oxyuranus genus, comprises several species, with the Coastal Taipan (Oxyuranus scutellatus) and the Inland Taipan (Oxyuranus microlepidotus) being the most renowned. These reptiles are highly venomous and belong to the elapid family, which includes other infamous snakes like the king cobra and the black mamba. According to @markwell2016killer, what sets the taipan apart, however, is its reputation as having the __most toxic venom of any snake in the world !__

In our current analysis, we will be focusing on the occurrences of a specific subspecies of the Coastal Taipan across the various states of Australia. The subgroup of the Coastal Taipans which has been scientifically named as Oxyuranus Scutellatus Scutellatus, is commonly found in the northern regions of Australia and is renowned for its agility and speed. It primarily feeds on small mammals, birds, and occasionally reptiles, using its potent venom to immobilize its prey swiftly. 

![The coastal taipan (Oxyuranus scutellatus)](taipan.jpg){#fig-taipan}

Characterized by its slender body, shiny scales, and formidable fangs, the Taipan is a formidable predator. Despite its fearsome reputation, these snakes are generally reclusive and rarely encountered by humans. They prefer to inhabit coastal regions, woodlands, and savannas, blending seamlessly into their natural surroundings as can be observed in @fig-taipan.

While the Coastal Taipans are not classified as endangered species, however, with rapid human activities such as urbanisation and encroachment of wildlife area for agricultural purposes, the habitat of these reptiles have been increasingly affected as a result of which, steps have been taken by wild life conservationists to preserve their natural habitats to the best extent possible.

### Data source:

- The data was sourced from the [Atlas of Living Australia (ALA)](https://www.ala.org.au/) using the `galah` R package.

- The weather station data to study impact of weather conditions on sightings was sourced from [National Climatic Data Centre (NCDC)](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets) using `rnoaa` package in R.

# Key assumptions

Based on the literature surveys for the Coastal Taipan, here are our assumptions while moving forward with our analysis:


1. Based on the information from the [Australia Museum](https://australian.museum/learn/animals/reptiles/coastal-taipan/), the Coastal Taipans are __active throughout the year__ but are observed to be most __commonly encountered during late winter to spring (August to December of a calendar year)__.
2. As can be inferred from its colloquial name, the Coastal Taipans are often observed __in the coastal regions of Australia.__ 
3. Based on a study by [Billabong Sanctuary](https://www.billabongsanctuary.com.au/coastal-taipan/#:~:text=Coastal%20taipans%20are%20common%20in,animals%20like%20rats%20and%20mice.), the Coastal Taipans are __not endangered and have probably increased in numbers__ due to the growth in the number of rats (who are the primary prey) in areas close to the human settlements.
4. Coastal Taipans depend primarily on their venom as their defensive mechanism and consider human interactions as an act of aggression. Consequently, the number of sightings across Australia can be __considered to be limited to certain regions and in small numbers__.
5. The Coastal Taipans, like any other snakes are __territorial in nature and do not migrate from their region over the years__.
:::

Although we will attempt to accurately analyse the data by obtaining it from reliable repositories, however, it is important to consider the limitations of the dataset while making critical conclusions based on the data in hand. Some of the limitations of the current dataset are delineated as follows:

:::{.callout-warning}
# Limitations of the data

1. Since the data which has been obtained from the [Atlast of Living Australia](https://www.ala.org.au) falls under the category of __observational data__, there could be instances of missing values. These instances will need to be filtered out while analysing the data from the repository.

2. Since the data is obtained from various sources, there could be inconsistencies in reporting the data.

3. While the data collection was done in an extensive and granular manner, there could be a lack of precision of the observations made for the exact latitude and longitude.

4. The dataset obtained from the Atlas of Living Australia __only reports for all the Coastal Taipans that have been sighted and recorded__. Hence, it does not report the entire population of these reptiles across the various regions of Australia. This may lead to inaccurate conclusions post analysis of the limited data in hand.


5. The dataset here consist of __observational data__ and in particular, occurrences data. Some of the limitations that are prevalent in such datasets are as follows :
     - The data here is obtained from various sources. As a result, there may be __non-uniformity in the data provided__. Each reporting authority may have their own interpretations of the data they may have provided.
     - The current dataset obtained is a subset of an observational data. These types of data are often plagued with lack of randomisation during the selection of        data. This may lead to biases in the dataset such as selection and systematic bias.
     - The data maybe misclassified or filled in non-uniform units by the various sources, leading to lack of accuracy of the overall dataset.

### Description of the Variables in the Dataset

The dataset contains data on observations of the Coastal Taipans (*Oxyuranus scutellatus scutellatus*) in Australia. The dataset has been organized into a tidy format. Below is a detailed description of each salient variable:

| Variable Name    | Data Type | Description |
|------------------|-----------|-------------|
| decimalLatitude  | dbl       | The latitude coordinate of the observation location. |
| decimalLongitude | dbl       | The longitude coordinate of the observation location. |
| eventDate        | date      | The date when the observation was made. |
| scientificName   | chr       | The scientific name of the observed species. In this dataset, it's *Oxyuranus scutellatus scutellatus*. |
| taxonConceptID   | chr       | A unique URL that provides information about the taxonomic concept for the species. |
| recordID         | chr       | A unique identifier for each observation record. |
| dataResourceName | chr       | The name of the data resource/provider. |
| occurrenceStatus | chr       | The status of the observation, indicating if the species is present or absent at the location. |
| eventRemarks     | chr       | Special remarks related to the event sighting. |
| eventTime        | datetime  | Time of the event sighting. |
| eventID          | chr       | A unique ID for each event observation. |
| samplingEffort   | chr       | An variable to indicate the sampling technique used. |
| samplingProtocol | chr       | A remark for the type of sighting. |


## Initial data analysis

### Data Source 

**Data Source:** The data was sourced from the [Atlas of Living Australia (ALA)](https://www.ala.org.au/) using the `galah` R package.

The weather station data to study impact of weather conditions on sightings was sourced from [National Climatic Data Centre (NCDC)](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets) using `rnoaa` package in R.

### Data Cleaning

**Data Cleaning Steps:**

1. The datatype for `eventDate` has been changed to datetime for accurate temporal analysis. \
2. Observations with missing event dates, longitude, or latitude were filtered out.
3. Redundant variables were dropped from the dataset to keep only the salient variables important for the current analysis.


**Methods to Check and Clean Data:**

- **Validity Checks and outlier analysis:** Ensure that the latitude and longitude values are within valid ranges. For latitude (-90 to 90) and for longitude (-180 to 180). This would help detect any unusual or erroneous data points.
- **Consistency Checks:** Make sure there aren't any discrepancies in the way data is represented across rows.
- **Missing Value Analysis:** Any missing values should be analyzed to understand the reason behind them.
- **Date Consistency:** Ensure that the event dates fall within expected ranges and are formatted correctly.


### Data Quality Check

```{r}
#| label: fig-vismiss
#| fig-cap: "Representation of missing values in the dataset"
vis_miss(taipan)
```
The `vis_miss()` function from the "visdat" package provides a visual representation of missing data in the dataset.

The plot illustrated in @fig-vismiss indicates __that about half of the total dataset has missing values__. These missing values can be observed majorly in the variables of eventRemarks,eventTime and eventID. In order to improve the quality of the overall data, we will consider either transforming these variables or removing them as a part of feature selection in the following sections.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-fivenum
#| tbl-cap: "Representation of five number summary of values in the dataset"
lat_summary <- taipan$decimalLatitude %>% fivenum()
long_summary <- taipan$decimalLongitude %>% fivenum()

summary_table <- tibble(
  Statistic = c("Minimum", "1st Quartile", "Median", "3rd Quartile", "Maximum"),
  Latitude = lat_summary,
  Longitude = long_summary
) 

kable(summary_table, format = "html", table.attr = "class='table'") %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), position = "center") %>%
  column_spec(1, border_right = TRUE) %>%  # Add a line between columns
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "lightblue")

```
The `fivenum()` function in R provides a summary of five-number statistics: the minimum, lower-hinge (25th percentile or first quartile), median (50th percentile), upper-hinge (75th percentile or third quartile), and the maximum.

By analyzing these statistics in @tbl-fivenum, we can get an overview of the distribution of latitudes and longitudes in the dataset. __The five number summary of the latitude and longitude values further allows us to validate the values with each latitude and longitude observation being within the maximum and minimum possible limits.__

### Data transformation and feature selection

As we are primarily interested in analysing the wild sightings of the Coastal Taipans across Australia, hence, we will filter out the data obtained from museums and animal sanctuaries. This information has been provided in the `event ID` column which will be used to filter the required data as shown in the code chunk below. It has been additionally assumed that the occurrences with no mention of the term "museum" have been considered as wild sightings in the context of the current study. 

```{r}
#| label: fig-dist
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of Coastal Taipan sightings in Australia"
taipan <- taipan %>% mutate(occurrence = if_else(str_detect(taipan$eventID,"museum"),"Museum","Wild"))
taipan$occurrence <- replace_na(taipan$occurrence,"Wild")

taipan_occurrs <- taipan %>% group_by(occurrence) %>% summarise(Count =  n())  

ggplot(taipan_occurrs, aes(x = occurrence,y = Count)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = occurrence)) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Coastal Taipan sightings",
       x = "Occurrence Type",
       y = "Number of sightings") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") + geom_label(aes(label =Count))

```

Figure @fig-dist displays the distribution of Taipan sightings categorized into two types: Museum and Wild. It's evident from the figure that a portion of the data is sourced from museums, which means these observations don't represent the natural behavior or occurrence of Taipans in their wild habitats.

For a comprehensive study of the natural behavior or occurrence patterns of Taipans, it's pertinent to focus solely on the "Wild" type data.

```{r}
 # Selecting only wild occurrences of Coastal Taipans
taipan_wild <- taipan %>% filter(occurrence =="Wild")
```

We have observed a total of __`r taipan %>% nrow()` occurrences across Australia__. However, this number has been obtained from the raw data which __will need to be cleaned further__.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">
Based on the initial data analysis, we will need to perform the following data cleaning operations:

1. Filter the data with valid sighting date for detailed temporal analysis.
2. Filter the data with valid values of longitude and latitude for detailed spatial analysis.
</div>

```{r}
taipan_wild <- taipan_wild %>% 
  rename(Longitude = decimalLongitude,
         Latitude = decimalLatitude) %>%
  mutate(eventDate = as.Date(eventDate)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(eventDate)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(Longitude)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(Latitude)) %>% select(-c("samplingEffort","samplingProtocol","taxonConceptID","recordID","dataResourceName"))
save(taipan_wild, file=here::here("data/taipan.rda"))

```

<div class="alert alert-block alert-success">
‚ÄºÔ∏èüí°
Upon performing the required data cleaning operation, we have a total of __`r taipan_wild %>% nrow()` wild sightings of Coastal Taipans across Australia__.
üí°‚ÄºÔ∏è
</div>


#### Combining data of sightings with weather data ‚õàÔ∏è

In order to explore the prevailing weather conditions during the sighting, we will need to merge the datasets from two different sources. Here, we will utilise the weather data reported from the various weather stations in Australia by utilising the RNOAA package which is maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The following code chunk allows us to obtain the weather conditions, namely precipitation (PRCP), maximum temperature (TMAX) and minimum temperature (TMIN). In order to utilise data from active weather stations, we have filtered those data whose last reported conditions were relayed after the year of 2020.
```{r}

aus_stations <- ghcnd_stations() |>
  filter(str_starts(id, "ASN")) |>
  filter(last_year >= 2020) |>
  mutate(wmo_id = as.numeric(wmo_id),
         name = str_to_lower(name)) |>
  select(-state, -gsn_flag) |>
  filter(element %in% c("PRCP", "TMAX", "TMIN")) |>
  nest(element: last_year) |>
  rowwise() |>
  filter(nrow(data) == 3) |>
  select(-data) 
```
Once we have obtained the weather data, we need to merge the sighting data with the weather conditions. For this purpose, we can utilise the geographical data (latitude and longitude) to merge the closest weather station data with the location of the Coastal Taipan sighting.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">
‚ÄºÔ∏è
Since it is difficult to exactly match the latitude and longitude of the sighting to the weather station, hence, we will convert the geographical data into spatial objects and then utilise the nearest feature function to merge the weather conditions of the location of the sighting to the closest weather reporting station. This has been done in the following code chunk.
‚ÄºÔ∏è
</div>

```{r}


# Convert the datasets into spatial objects
taipan_sf <- st_as_sf(taipan_wild, coords = c("Longitude", "Latitude"), crs = 4326)
aus_stations_sf <- st_as_sf(aus_stations, coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), crs = 4326)

# Perform the nearest neighbor join
nearest_stations <- st_nearest_feature(taipan_sf, aus_stations_sf)

# Combine the datasets
combined_data <- cbind(taipan_wild, aus_stations[nearest_stations, ])

combined_data <- as.data.frame(combined_data)
unique_id <- unique(combined_data$id)
```


Once we have successfully mapped the sighting data with each of the weather stations, let us try to observe the most frequent sightings with respect to its closest weather station. 


```{r}
#| label: fig-wstation
#| fig-cap: "Number of sightings for each weather station"
combined_count <- combined_data %>% group_by(name) %>% summarise(Count = n())
top_2 <- c("cooktown airport","townsville aero")

ggplot(combined_count,aes(x = reorder(name,Count),y = Count)) + geom_col() + coord_flip() + theme_classic() + ggtitle("Number of Coastal Taipan sightings \n for each weather station")  + geom_col(data = ~filter(.x, name %in% top_2),fill = "darkred") + geom_label(data = ~filter(.x, name %in% top_2),aes(label = Count),vjust=0.8) +  labs(x = "Weather station name",y = "Number of Coastal Taipan sightings",caption = "Source: National Climatic Data Center and Atlas of Living Australia")
```

@fig-wstation illustrates the number of Coastal Taipan sightings for each of the weather stations in Australia. Based on the illustration, we will be able to narrow down our search for the location with frequent sightings of the reptile and can drill down our analysis to obtain weather information. 

Here, we observe that the weather stations Cooktown Airport and Townsville Aero have significantly higher number of sightings when compared to the rest of the data. Let us pull the weather information for these weather stations through the below code chunk.


```{r}
narrogin <- aus_stations |>
  filter(name %in% top_2) |>
  rowwise() |>
  mutate(ts = list(meteo_pull_monitors(
    monitors = id, var = c("PRCP", "TMAX", "TMIN"),
    date_min = "1950-01-01",
    date_max = "2023-09-13") |>
      select(-id))) |>
  rename(Latitude = latitude, Longitude = longitude, elev = elevation) |> select(id, Longitude, Latitude, elev, name, wmo_id, ts) %>%
  unnest(ts) |>
  mutate(tmax = tmax/10, tmin = tmin/ 10)

```
In the next part, we will create a new variable called `sighting` with values of either 0 or 1 to mark the sighting of the Coastal Taipan. This variable is important because,

<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">
the weather data obtained is for all the possible dates which match our time period filter. __This does not necessarily mean that a Coastal Taipan was observed on that particular day__. Hence, upon merging the weather and the sighting dataset, it is __important to distinguish the days (obtained by `eventDate`) which mark the sighting of a Coastal Taipan__. We will be primarily interested to analyse the prevailing weather conditions on these particular days for the choice of our weather stations.

</div>

```{r}
subset_combined_data <- combined_data %>% filter(name %in% top_2)
taipan_weather <- right_join(subset_combined_data,narrogin,by = c("id","eventDate"="date"))
taipan_weather <- taipan_weather %>% mutate(sighting = if_else(!is.na(occurrenceStatus) ,1,0))
save(taipan_weather, file=here::here("data/taipan_weather_sighting.rda"))
```

### When are the Coastal Taipans most likely to be observed ?

```{r}
#| label: fig-sightnum
#| fig-cap: "Monthly number of Coastal Taipan sightings in Australia"
taipan_grouped <- taipan_wild %>% group_by(month(eventDate,label=TRUE)) %>% summarise(sightings = n())

taipan_grouped <- taipan_grouped %>% rename("month" = `month(eventDate, label = TRUE)`)



ggdotchart(taipan_grouped, y = "sightings", 
           x = "month",
           color = "sightings",                       
           add = "segments",
           add.params = list(color = "lightgray", size = 2),                             
           dot.size = 8,
           rotate=FALSE,
           label = "sightings",
           group = "month",                                
           font.label = list(color = "white", size = 8, 
                             vjust = 0, face = 'bold'),               
           ggtheme = theme_economist()                        
           ) + theme(legend.position = "none",panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'cornsilk'),axis.text = element_text(face = "bold"),axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45,vjust = 1)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = 2, color = "lightgray") + labs(y = "Number of sightings", 
                                                                       x= "Month of sighting",
                                                                       caption = "Source: Atlas of Linving Australia (ALA)",subtitle = "Time period: 1915-2020") + ggtitle("Total number of \n Coastal Taipan sightings in Australia")  

```


<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">

üí°
@fig-sightnum illustrates the number of Coastal Taipans reported till date for each month. We can observe that the sightings are __higher between the months of July to December__ when compared to the rest of the year. This can be a result of the prevailing monsoon conditions in Australia which closely corroborates with our assumption stated in @sec-ref1.

Some of the reasons why the Coastal Taipans are observed to be more active are as follows:

1. __Breeding season__: The Coastal Taipans are highly active during the breeding season which closely conincides with the monsoon season in Australia.
2. __Increased prey availability__: The monsoon season in northern Australia typically brings heavy rainfall, which can lead to flooding in some areas. This flooding forces small mammals, reptiles, and other prey animals out of their burrows and hiding places, making them more accessible to Coastal Taipans. The increased prey availability during the monsoon can lead to an uptick in snake activity as they take advantage of the abundance of food.
3. __Temperature and humidity__: Reptiles are ectothermic in nature, meaning their body temperature is highly influenced by the environmental temperature. Monsoon season generally brings about warm and humid conditions. These conditions additionally improve the metabolism and mobility in reptiles which allows for higher activity and increased number of Coastal Taipan sightings.
4. __Migratory behaviour__: Due to increased mobility in the reptiles during the monsoon season, some Coastal Taipans exhibit migrate behaviour for better conditions and availability of prey. Migrations can often lead to human interactions and hence, their consequent sightings.

### Where are the Coastal Taipans most commonly observed in Australia? {#sec-ref2}

```{r}
#| label: fig-sightloc
#| fig-cap: "Regions of Coastal Taipan sightings in Australia"
# Assuming your dataset is named `sightings` and has columns `latitude` and `longitude`
leaflet(data = taipan) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircles(lng = ~decimalLongitude, lat = ~decimalLatitude, popup = paste("Scientific name:",taipan$scientificName, "<br>",
                                                              "Latitude:",taipan$decimalLatitude,"<br>",
                                                              "Longitude:",taipan$decimalLongitude,"<br>"), radius = 50, color = "red")

```


```{r}
#| label: tbl-source
#| tbl-cap: "Number of sightings reported by each data source"
sourceSightings <- taipan %>% 
                   group_by(dataResourceName) %>% 
                   summarise(count = n())
colnames(sourceSightings) <- c("Data Source", "Number of Sightings")

kable(sourceSightings, format = "html", table.attr = "class='table'") %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), position = "center") %>%
  column_spec(1, border_right = TRUE) %>%  # Add a line between columns
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "lightblue")
```

@fig-sightloc illustrates that, in alignment with its name, most Coastal Taipan sightings occur in coastal regions. Additionally, considering that a significant portion of the data comes from the "Queensland Museum provider for OZCAM" as observed by @tbl-source, it can be determined that a majority of these sightings are __concentrated in the coastal areas of Queensland.__ It is also particularly interesting to note that __one sighting observed in the Northern Territory indicating a possibility of migration and future possibilities of higher sightings in this region.__

<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">

üí°üí°
The Coastal Taipan's preference for coastal regions in Australia can be attributed to the habitat, climate, and prey availability in these areas. Coastal regions provide a favorable environment with adequate warmth, humidity, and shelter. These conditions are conducive for the Taipan's survival and reproduction. Additionally, coastal areas offer a rich biodiversity, ensuring ample prey for the snake. __The vegetation in these regions, like grasslands and woodlands, offers suitable hiding spots for the snake and its prey, leading to a higher likelihood of the Taipan being found in these areas.__
</div>

### Has there been a rise in the number of Coastal Taipans in Australia over the years?

```{r}
#| label: fig-trend
#| fig-cap: "Trend of Coastal Taipan Sightings Over the years of 1915-2020"
population_count <- taipan_wild %>% 
  mutate(year = year(eventDate)) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  filter(year != "1915") %>%
  summarise(count = n())

trend <- ggplot(population_count, aes(x = year, y = count)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = "Yearly Count"), linewidth = 1) +
  geom_smooth(aes(color = "Trend Line"), method = "loess", se = FALSE, size = 1.5,linetype = 'dashed') +
  labs(title = "Trend of Coastal Taipan Sightings Over the Years",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Number of Sightings",
       color = "Legend") +
  theme_classic()
ggplotly(trend)

```
@fig-trend demonstrates a noticeable increase in sightings over the years, potentially suggesting a growth in the Coastal Taipan population, indicating they __might not be "endangered".__ However, there are caveats to consider.

:::{.callout-warning}
# Caveats
__Sightings vs. Population__: The number of sightings does not necessarily equate to the actual population. An increase in sightings could be due to increased human activity in the taipan's habitat or better reporting mechanisms.

__Incomplete Data__: The dataset might not cover all sightings, especially as it has limited data sources or regions.

__External Factors__: Factors like urban development, habitat destruction, or climate change can influence the habitats and distribution of species, which can subsequently influence sighting reports.

### Are the Coastal Taipans limited to certain regions of Australia ?

In @sec-ref2, we were able to observe that the Coastal Taipans are observed to be sighted close to the coasts. In this section, we will be focused on assessing whether the sighting locations of the Coastal Taipans suggest that these reptiles are limited to certain regions of Australia only. The same will be assessed through the generation of a null plot and testing a hypothesis. The hypothesis and the null generating mechanism are as follows:

<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">
$H_o$ : Coastal Taipans are not limited to a single region and can be sighted all over Australia. \

# Key takeaway
Upon analysing the plot null lineup plots in @fig-nullplot, we observed that of the 8 test cases, __7 people were able to recognise the plot 4 as the most unique plot__ due to the scatter points (sighting locations) being limited to only the coastal regions of Australia. The P-value for the following result is __`r pvisual(7,8,20)[3]`__ which __suggests that the null hypothesis can be rejected__ and we can conclude that there is significant evidence in the data to suggest that Coastal Taipans are __majorly limited to the North-Eastern coast of Australia.__

### Has the geographical distribution of Coastal Taipans remained consistent over the years?

Snakes are typically reclusive and territorial. Given this characteristic, it's intriguing to consider whether coastal taipans exhibit similar behavior. Specifically, it's of interest to determine if coastal taipans remain in their established habitats due to their inherent nature or external factors or if there are distinct regions they consistently inhabit. This investigation will be facilitated by generating a null plot and conducting hypothesis testing. The pertinent hypotheses and the mechanism for generating the null distribution are outlined as follows:

<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">
$H_o$: The geographical distribution of Coastal Taipan sightings has remained consistent over the years, with no significant difference in distribution between the periods pre-2000s and post-2000s. \
$H_1$: The geographical distribution of Coastal Taipan sightings has changed between the periods pre-2000s and post-2000s.

Null generating mechanism: Usage of the "null_permute" function to permute the `eventCategory` (Pre or Post 2000s categorisation) values of the Coastal Taipan sightings.

```{r}
#| label: fig-lineup

taipan_wild <- taipan_wild %>%
  mutate(eventCategory = ifelse(year(eventDate) < 2000, "pre-2000s", "post-2000s"))

### How are the weather conditions like in the areas with Coastal Taipan sightings ? 

In this section, we will be interested to find any insights with respect to the weather in the locations with high Coastal Taipan sightings.

#### Does rain play a role in the sightings of the Coastal Taipans ? ‚õàÔ∏è

```{r}
#| label: fig-rain
#| fig-cap: "Number of Coastal Taipan sightings on days of observed precipitation"
taipan_rain <- taipan_weather %>% filter(sighting == 1) %>% mutate(rain = if_else(!is.na(prcp) & prcp> 0,"Rain recorded","No rain recorded"))

taipan_rain_group <-
  taipan_rain %>% group_by(rain) %>% summarise(Total = n())
rain_plot <-
  ggplot(data = taipan_rain_group, aes(
    x = as.factor(rain),
    y = Total,
    fill = factor(rain)
  )) + geom_col(color='black') + geom_label(aes(label = Total)) + theme_classic() + theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(x = "Rain indication for the day of sighting",y = "Total number of sightings")
rain_plot + scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3")
```
:::{.callout-note}
# Key takeaway
Based on our analysis of @fig-rain, we can observe that of the 27 observations, __23 of the sightings took place on days with no recorded precipitation__ while __only 4 sightings took place on days with recorded precipitation__. This suggests that the __precipitation may not have a strong association with the Coastal Taipan sightings__. However, it must also be kept in mind that the current sample of the dataset is too small to generate any strong conclusions from the data and we may require further data to support our analysis. 
:::

#### How are the temperatures during the days of sightings ? ‚òÄÔ∏è

Let us now explore the minimum and maximum temperatures on the given day of Coastal Taipan sightings and analyse any further insights. 


```{r warning=FALSE}
#| label: fig-temp
#| fig-cap: "Temperature range on the days of Coastal Taipan sightings"
taipan_weather1 <- taipan_weather %>% filter(sighting == 1) 
taipan_weather1 <- taipan_weather1 %>% mutate(observation = 1:nrow(taipan_weather1))
taipan_weather1$observation <- factor(taipan_weather1$observation)
pl_temp <- ggplot(taipan_weather1, aes(y = observation)) +
  geom_dumbbell(aes(x = tmin, xend = tmax),
                color = "darkgray",
                size = 1, dot_guide = FALSE, 
                size_x = 3,  size_xend = 3,
                colour_xend = "#F69541", colour_x = "#699DC6") +
    geom_text(aes(x = tmin, label = tmin), hjust = 1.5) +
  geom_text(aes(x = tmax, label = tmax), hjust = -0.2) +
  xlim(0,40) + labs(x = "Minimum and maximum temperatures observed (degree Celsius)",
                                      y = "Coastal Taipan sighting unique observation")  + theme_classic()
   
pl_temp + geom_vline(xintercept = mean(taipan_weather1$tmax,na.rm = TRUE),alpha = 0.5,linetype =2,color = 'red') +  
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(taipan_weather1$tmin,na.rm = TRUE),alpha = 0.5,linetype =2,color = 'blue') +
    scale_linetype_manual(values = "Mean Temperature", name = "Line Type") +
    annotate(
    "text",
    x = 35,
    y = 8,
    colour = "red",
    label = paste0("Average maximum temperature:",round(mean(taipan_weather1$tmax,na.rm = TRUE),1)),
    size = unit(3, "pt") 
  ) +
      annotate(
    "text",
    x = 5,
    y = 14,
    colour = "blue",
    label = paste0("Average minimum temperature:",round(mean(taipan_weather1$tmin,na.rm = TRUE),1)),
    size = unit(3, "pt")
      )
  

```

:::{.callout-note}
# Key takeaway
Upon analysing the maximum and minimum temperatures on the days of Coastal Taipan sightings as illustrated by @fig-temp, we can observe that the majority of the sightings were recorded on days with relatively higher maximum and minimum temperatures. This suggests that the __mobility of the reptiles are higher during warmer conditions__ leading to higher probability of their sightings. __Higher temperatures also induce lower mobility among the prey of the Taipans to protect themselves from the heat, as a result of which, the reptiles are also on the move to hunt__.

The average maximum and minimum temperatures visualised by the two vertical lines in the plot are 28.1 and 19 degree celsius respectively, suggesting warm conditions.

## Summary 


Based on our detailed analysis of the Coastal Taipan sightings, following are our key takeaways:


<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">

üí°üí°
\
1. The spatial analysis suggests that the Coastal Taipans are territorial in nature, thereby inhabiting the coastal regions of Queensland with possibility of migration towards Northern Territory in the future.

2. Based on the frequency of sightings, the Coastal Taipans are not endagered. However, they are extremely reclusive and avoid human contact. Hence, their occurrences and sightings are rare as they are mostly confined to their habitats.

3. While migration of the Coastal Taipans maybe a possibility in the future, based on the data, there is not enough strong evidence to suggest that there has been a significant change in the Coastal Taipan's habitat.

4. Contrary to popular belief, the data does not exhibit a strong evidence to suggest that the sightings of Coastal Taipans are higher on days of recorded precipitation. However, the Coastal Taipans do exhibit higher mobility during the monsoon period resulting in higher sightings.

5. Coastal Taipans appear to be especially active on warm days, possibly due to their increased mobility and metabolism, consequently resulting in higher sightings on these days.

## Introduction

- We will conduct an extensive analysis of tourism data in Australia to better understand how it may affect the sightings of Coastal Taipans (Oxyuranus Scutellatus Scutellatus), shedding light on the intricate relationship between human travel for different purposes and the sighting of these remarkable reptiles.
- Our initial step involves the collection and analysis of tourism data, where we will scrutinize trends such as number of tourist, their travel purpose, and their preferred destinations across different states of Australia. This data will help us gain insights into the fluctuations in tourist visits, including peak seasons, busy quarter of the year and popular regions of visit.
- Subsequently, we will delve into ecological data related to the sightings of Coastal Taipans. By combining this ecological data with tourism trends, we can identify potential areas where tourism activities and the  sightings of these snakes may overlap. 
- Finally, we will investigate whether there is a significant relationship between the presence of the species and the level of tourism in the region. This analysis will allow us to decide weather we reject the null hypothesis or not. 


# task 1

```{r}
#download the tourism data
load("data/tourism.rda")
```

- Each trip is one person as described in the survey method. https://www.tra.gov.au/en/domestic/national-visitor-survey-methodology.html#:~:text=The%20survey%20runs,a%20private%20dwelling.

## Temporal Analysis

```{r}
temp <- tourism %>% filter(str_detect(tourism$Region, "Townsville")) 

unique(temp$Region)

temp %>% filter(Purpose == "Total") %>% 
  arrange(-Trips)
```

- **Following research on Google Maps, we've observed that "South Townsville - Railway Estate," "Townsville - South," and "Townsville City - North Ward" are all geographically close to Townsville Airport. However, for the purpose of our analysis, we have selected Townsville City - North Ward" due to its greater availability of tourism data compared to the other three areas. This choice allows us to conduct a more comprehensive and robust analysis.**
- **Cookstown Airport, initially part of our dataset, is absent from the tourism dataset. As a result, we have excluded it from our analysis.** 
- **The table presents the number of trips taken during each quarterly period in the aforementioned regions, categorized by various purposes.**

## Temporal Analysis
```{r}

#top 10 locations

top_location <- c("Ingham", "Townsville City - North Ward", "Mackay", "Tewantin","Rockhampton City", "Gladstone", "Redcliffe", "Cairns City", "Daintree")

top_tourism <- tourism %>% filter(Region %in% top_location)

top_tourism <- top_tourism %>% 
  index_by(Quarter) %>% 
  group_by(Purpose) %>% 
  summarise(Trips = mean(Trips))

q3 <- top_tourism %>% filter(quarter(Quarter) == 3)

# Facet by visiting reasons
facet_purpose <- top_tourism %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Quarter, 
             y = Trips)) +
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point(data = q3, aes(x = Quarter, y = Trips), colour = "red") +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~Purpose)

total_tourism <- top_tourism %>% 
  filter(Purpose == "Total") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Quarter, 
             y = Trips)) +
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point(data = q3 %>% filter(Purpose == "Total"), 
             aes(x = Quarter, y = Trips), colour = "red") +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE, linetype = "dashed") +  
  theme_minimal() # shall I use linear or non-linear line of best fit?

ggplotly(facet_purpose)

ggplotly(total_tourism)
```


- **Business trips often allows travelers to reside or roam near coastal areas, which means that including them in your plans to visit Taipan, a predominantly coastal location, may not be the most logical choice.**
- **The interactive capabilities of Plotly have made it possible to discover that the majority of peaks corresponding to the various reasons for these trips occur in Quarter 3, upon analyzing the facet plot representing trip purposes.**
- **Based on those peaks, it is safe to assert that seasonality can be easily identified.**
- **We can also see an upward trend in the yearly trend for the number of trips taken to regions of Ingham, "Townsville City - North Ward, Mackay, Tewantin, Rockhampton City, Gladstone, Redcliffe, Cairns City, Daintree , with the exception of the sharp decline in 2020, which is primarily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.**


# task 2

# Summary

- **We began with a tourism dataset and specifically focused on regions near Townsville, as it was one of the primary areas where we could observe the presence of the wild species "Coastal Taipans (Oxyuranus Scutellatus Scutellatus)."**
- **Next, we had to narrow our focus to Townsville City - North Ward, as it exhibited a significantly higher number of wild sightings compared to areas closer to the Townsville airport.** 
- **Subsequently, we identified the top nine regions with the highest number of wild sightings for our temporal analysis. This list includes Ingham, Townsville City - North Ward, Mackay, Tewantin, Rockhampton City, Gladstone, Redcliffe, Cairns City, and Daintree.** 
- **Then, we merged the tourism dataset with our wild sighting data and investigated whether there was any correlation between tourism activity in a specific location and the number of occurrences of wild species sightings.**
- **Upon visualizing the joined data and conducting a more precise analysis using permutation tests, we asked the input of 10 individuals to check if there are any variations within the visuals. But, none of them were able to identify any distinctions among the visual representations.**
- **This testing leaves us to conclude that the tourism in the regions had nothing to do with the number of wild sightings, as those sightings were scattered away from the hot spots (where maximum trips were taken)**
